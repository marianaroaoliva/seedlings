When the elastic language 
underneath our 
words starts to fold or
rot, we get 
meaning compost. The cardboard peels,
 shell fabrications,
 and glittering seeds
of hypothesis and ideas that we discard 
break 
down into microcosmic games, phosphate-rich combinations of 
waves that encode objective—though not “true”—hallucinations, restless accounts of mental processes. 

Contrary to the common utilitarian belief, 
none of the purple unconscious we spit out when we speak motifs and shapes 
ever disappears. 
There’s a complex and playful cycle that autonomos products and particles of the endless mind follow

like water sunlight daylight foliage atoms books

 and every other fruit of the restless Earth.

Earthworms come to reclaim every precise sentence we paint or utter,
 fungi grows over everything our senses touch.

Lines on the land like butcher recipes
on a live animal, behold your geomantic form 
being erased. 

Earthquakes are nothing for sugarcane ghosts.
They sit still through them and write conjurations. 

Jupiter brought new talismans
into this heavy sphere,
he believes it is futile to try making 
definitions from scratch. 

Harvesting flowers is still plausible. 
They planted riddles like seeds. 

Looking in quietness
at the obedient drops of water sliding 
down the window, the ships
that sail across the ocean, the yellow 
leaves responding to the wind with 
a healing switch in point of view. 

Compassion crystal stone, don’t emigrate.
A purificatory bath will serve as explanation.

Money may stops herbs from 
walking up and down the continent like animals
but not from the pursuit of
breaking through concrete sulfur sidewalks, bursting 
open empty treasure homes.

Ingenuity brought them to an oak sapling. 

For breakfast a stew of hominy and molasses, and a gooseberry cobbler.

The moon found them slaughtering a muskrat
pouring scalding water through an incision 
in the intestinal membrane. 

Where before a kindly constellation
an abandoned planet with miscellany habits
now nothing but a carcass—arteries haphazardly parboiled. 

For lunch a bushel of fermented muscadine grapes and pickled okra.

Nearby insects wore a veil of skin and ashes, the 
unwanted entrails and fibers left there 
like an abandoned house. Perhaps 
the animal should have migrated to another planet, one 
where the atmosphere helps one believe 
with conviction in mold, and in sage, and in death. Not this one
where signs make everything scientific seem unfruitful, where 
reason and evidence, and funerals and dirt could mean 
nothing to them. 

For dinner a chopped cabbage, a silk corn in a crock, and a flat flint rock.

Even the tonsils they took. Made a mystery moonshine
milk splattering, swallowed mustard and relish
coals sprinkled with mushy sulfur
blinking.

Arousing the discovery of vanity, he desires everybody, enhancing his relationship frustration. 

Who is he? A hungry beetle who has never been to the region where the wind sprouts? An apple who feels the wasps caress him as he walks about the country?

The transition is vulnerability and softness, submission to the eroticization of effeminate mannerisms, a swallowing of the generosity of strangers. To speak of envy of the artifact of hormones, or to fixate on surgeries would be a perverse objectification. He will miss the lesbian propositioning, the cisgender avoidance, the occassional pleasurable disgust at physiology. 

 Did he sit in front of the TV, mindless, stringing thoughts for a crow? Kissing knives, feeling superstitious of frogs, of dresses, of eggs, of fluids? 

He’s not there for the catcalling or the delighting in pornographic gendered passivity. His lubrication is for the erotic drive of intersex piloerection, masturbating to the tension of connection, undressing while thinking of earlobe stimulation, osmolality, and touch.
